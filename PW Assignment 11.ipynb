    ">>>Multiprocessing in Python is a way to run multiple tasks or processes simultaneously on your computer's processor. Normally, when you run a Python program, it runs sequentially, one line at a time. But with multiprocessing, you can divide your program into smaller tasks and run them simultaneously, making use of multiple processors if available.\n",

    ">>Imagine we have a big task that takes a long time to complete, like baking a cake. Normally, you would mix the ingredients, put the cake in the oven, and wait for it to bake before moving on to the next task. Multiprocessing allows you to have multiple ovens and mixers, so you can mix the batter in one mixer while the cake is baking in another oven. This way, you can save time and complete the task faster.\n",
    "\n",
    ">>Similarly, in programming, multiprocessing allows you to split a big task into smaller parts and run them simultaneously. Each part can be assigned to a separate processor, if available, which can work on it independently. This can significantly speed up the execution of your program, especially if you have a computer with multiple processors or cores.\n",

    ">>Multiprocessing is useful in various scenarios, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>CPU-intensive tasks: If your program involves heavy calculations or processing that can benefit from parallel execution, multiprocessing can speed up the task by distributing the workload across multiple processors.\n",
    "Improving responsiveness: If your program needs to perform multiple tasks at the same time, multiprocessing allows you to run them concurrently, making your program more responsive and efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    ">>Parallelizing I/O-bound operations: If your program involves tasks that are primarily waiting for input/output operations, such as reading and writing files or making network requests, multiprocessing can help you take advantage of the idle time and perform other tasks in parallel."
